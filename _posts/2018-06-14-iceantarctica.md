Robin has successfully defended his PhD thesis "Loop flows in the Kuramoto model" in mathematics at the University of Geneva. The thesis is full of interesting, new results related to synchrony, how it may occur, in how many forms it can exist in a given system and how many of those solutions are stable. Many of these results have been published in the Journal of Mathematical Physics, the New Journal of Physics and Chaos. Congratulations Dr. Delabays !
