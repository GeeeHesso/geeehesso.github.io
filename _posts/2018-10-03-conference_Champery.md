The school of engineering at the U of Applied Sciences of Western Switzerland
is organizing, again (!) an international conference on electric power systems. 
Again (!) it will take place in Champ√©ry, and again (!) in February - this time 2019 -
why change a winning formula ? The 2017 edition turned out to be a big success and who 
knows, we'll manage to turn this event into the Woodstock of power systems (whatever 
that may mean). Be there or be square : more than twenty invited speakers from eleven countrie, all of them famous worldwide for their expertise in electric power engineering, control, network theory and so forth. Please follow the link below for registration
and further information on this great event in a great venue !
