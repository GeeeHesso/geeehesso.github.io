Don't you find it curious that when people say "sustainability" or "renewables" they seem to mean the same thing ? Which, by the way likely indicates that they don't know the meaning of either words. Well, sustainable means that something is economically, environmentally and socially acceptable - that it does not spend more riches than it generates, that it does not waste away resources faster than nature renews them and that it does not generate societal inequalities. The existence of these three pillars on which sustainability rests apparently needed to be recalled and 
this is what I did in a recent article in "Le Nouvelliste" (in french).
