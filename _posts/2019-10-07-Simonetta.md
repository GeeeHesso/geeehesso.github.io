I had the great chance and pleasure to meet with federal councillor Simonetta Sommaruga. She came and made a visit to Sion and stopped by our institute to talk about energy. She is a very smart person genuinely interested in collecting people's opinion to get a better picture of the problems she faces - in this particular case, how to implement the energy transition faster and more efficiently. Very encouraging to have members of our top-government display such a high level of availability and readiness to listen to people. I'm very happy to have had the opportunity to meet with her! Too bad I'm barely visible, on the left-hand-side of the picture below ;-)
