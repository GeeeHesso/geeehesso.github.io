We recently started a research project funded by Swissgrid, Switzerland's electric transport system's operator. They generously offered to fund the research activities of our colleague Koen van Walstijn, towards his PhD degree. We are thrilled at starting this partnership - it is not every day that a private partner offers you to fund scientific research without too many strings attached. Looking forward to know better how future electric power grids will operate !
