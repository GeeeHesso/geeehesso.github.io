It took us a long time to get this published. And we could have good reasons to be frustrated at how that manuscript was editorially handled until it got published. But then it was well worth the effort and the patience : our theory identifying the most vulnerable components in large electric power grids got published in Science Advances ! Congratulations to Melvyn and Laurent for a fantastic job !
