PanTaGruEl, our new Open Access, dynamical model of the synchronous grid of Continental Europe is up and running and available online ! You can freely download it on 

https://zenodo.org/record/2642175#.XhxFHet7mfV

The model has been designed primarily to investigate disturbance propagation in the continental Europe transmission grid. Its (almost!) unique feature is that it has geographical localization of all buses, lines and power plants. Additionally, it proposes a number of standard functionalities such as

- a demographic algorithm to distribute national demands on network buses
- a merit-order based OPF economic dispatch of power generation
- realistic electrical parameters for transmission lines and dynamical parameters for generators and loads

The model is meant to evolve, become more precise and include further functionalities in the future. It has been developed for use with Matpower. We would be happy to  develop it further for use in a different language, or with added functionalities upon demand. For any suggestions and/or requests please contact philippe.jacquod@hevs.ch or laurentpagnier@math.arizona.edu . We also welcome any feedback you may have.
