Robin is co-organizing a workshop on the "Geometry of Complex Webs". Very interesting idea as this is not your usual meeting. Instead it intends to bring together people
from very diverse backgrounds and interests, that have in common to be related to networks/graphs - a.k.a. "webs" - and in particular their geometric aspects. Broadly distributed audience of mathematicians, 

all of which related to geometric aspects of complex webs. Hence, the targeted audience includes, but is not restricted to, mathematicians (theoretical and applied), life scientists, computer scientists, and engineers - I suppose physicists fall in the category of "applied mathematicians" ?
