Following the oral exam which he passed with flying colors in December 2019, Melvyn will publicly defend his PhD thesis on "Local Vulnerabilities and Global Robustness of Coupled Dynamical Systems on Complex Networks" on Thursday 6th February 2020 at 16:00 at EPFL-Valais. The outcome is not officially known and will depend on what wine will be served after the defense (to be checked before the defense...) But with a number of nice publications, including one Physical Review Letters and on Science Advances, it will anyway be an interesting presentation.
