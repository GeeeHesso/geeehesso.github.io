			My research group is in the <a class= link href="https://www.hevs.ch/en/hautes-ecoles/school-of-engineering/">School of Engineering</a> at the <a class=link href="https://www.hevs.ch/en/">University of Applied Sciences of Western Switzerland</a>. Our research is on electric power systems, but is slowly starting to include other network-coupled dynamical systems such as information technology networks, consensus algorithms, gas and water networks and so forth. Originally, our interest was in getting a better understanding of how electric power will be produced, transmitted, distributed and consumed -  and perhaps even stored - with the upcoming energy transition and all the changes that the latter brings about. 
			</p>
			<p class=main>The topic is broad and while generally interested in aspects of energy efficiency, we soon found ourselves focusing on aspects of power grids stability and multi-stability, on issues of network security of operation - from overall network robustness to specific, local network vulnerabilities - and last but not least, on analogies between electric power systems and related models (the notorious Kuramoto model) on complex networks and superconductivity/superfluidity. In these pages you will find some relatively concise information on our research activities and interests. I delibarately decided to keep it short. If you're interested to know more, please do not hesitate to contact me (<i  onclick="display_mail_test_click(dis_PJ,'mailPJ','envPJ',el_PJ)"

			). Further documents and info can be obtained on our <a class=link href="https://github.com/geeehesso">github.</a>

			Right now (spring 2023) the <a class=link href=/people>group</a> is composed of one senior academic associate, three PhD students, a Master's student, and I. I am always interested in meeting motivated and skilled young researchers. If you are interested in joining the group either as a postdoc or a PhD student, do not hesitate to contact me (

		). Keep in mind, however, that we are doing theoretical physics/mathematics/theoretical electrical engineering; strong mathematical skills and an interest for conceptual thinking are a prerequisite.</p>
