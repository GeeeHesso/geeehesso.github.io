Note to get the site online on an other adress

1/ Configure the 'A' records with the DNS provider
	Must be set at a special adress:
		185.199.108.153
		185.199.109.153
		185.199.110.153
		185.199.111.153

2/ Wait. If can take from a couple hours to two days for the change to make effect
	check with:
		dig etranselec.ch +noall +noanswer

3/ Once the changes are done, change the custom domain in the Github page's setting

4/ (Optional) Check the Https box
	Might have to wait a few hours/days for this option to be avaiable.
